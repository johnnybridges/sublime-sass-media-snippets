SASS Media Snippets
---

Because i'm lazy. Quick snippets for sublime text 3, because I hate writing this 100x/day:

```
@include media($sm) {

}
```

Now I write `meds` and tab instead.


Usage
====

There are four different snippets triggered by the following keywords:

1. `meds` -> `$sm`
2. `medm` -> `$md`
3. `medl` -> `$lg`
4. `med` -> `$sm / $md / $lg`
